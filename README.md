# FAQ

### Are these addons safe/approved by IMC?
This has got to be the most asked question any addon author gets. It's also the stupidest question anyone ever asks. IMC doesn't have the time to go around approving every addon that shows up on the reddit homepage. They would rather spend their time working on bugfixes, new content, and managing their game. Waiting for an addon to get "approved" before using it is a good way to never use any addons ever. For the same reasons, IMC also isn't going to go around banning people for using addons. If you honestly believe this, then you're not very bright. Sorry, thems tha facts yo!
